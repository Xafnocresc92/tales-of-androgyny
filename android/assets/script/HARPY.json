Instead, you can sense the harpy stalking around you, inspecting you closely.  Finally, with a squawk, she rears up, takes off into the air, and grabs your clothes with her talons, hoisting you into the air."},

The view is startling, but breathtaking - as the sun visibly sets below far off mountains, a shadow is cast across the land, and the sky dyes itself in vivid orange and purples."},

Again, a dark thought enters your mind, as the harpies converge and attempt to steal her bounty, resulting in you plummeting to the ground amidst the struggle.  Thankfully, the other harpies are content to screech and caw at you."},
			{"text": "You see small inlets lining a mountain face, a sheer drop down to the valley below, and you wonder if they're naturally made or somehow carved out, seeing how regular they are. In most, if not all of them, is a bundle of straw and twigs - likely brought by the harpies from miles away, much like yourself."},

			{"text": "It occurs to you that she hadn't said a word to you in between taking you back to her home and anally violating you - she was so swift at it, in fact, that you're still not able to understand it. You know she has a cock and you know your ass feels full, but their true connection is only slowly dawning."},  
			{"text": "You're hanging quite nearly over the ledge, and you can see downwards that you can't actually see where the sky ends and the ground begins, and you aren't too keen on going down to investigate. She thrusts from behind, flat against you, and you push back to prevent from sliding forward - which means you're an active participant in this consummation."},

			{"text": "Her romantic overtures aren't exactly unrequited - she becomes audibly irritated with you whenever you cover her nesting material in sticky, wasted semen, which itself is a daily occurence, coinciding with her daily matings, which instill in you a certain perverse desire, the tangible result of which is a spurt of semen that never fails to bring a redness to your cheeks."},

Still, they often gather and gawk and squawk as you attend to your \"wifely\" duties, and the fire that you feel in your at-the-time harpy-invaded hole is nothing compared to the shame of their bird-brained jeers and misaimed hoots of encouragement."},
			{"text": "Well, not nothing - your harpy wife's chubby bird schlong rubs the stretched-thin membrane of your anus with so much determined friction that no one would ever mistake, at a glance, your puffy, irritated hole as anything but something that a harpy-with-a-dick has on lockdown, but, still.  It's embarrassing."},
			{"text": "Your time as an adventurer becomes a distant dream while you live your life high atop that nameless mountain peak, wetting her nesting material with your wasted semen while she fills your stretched and pummeled rectum with hers.  You regret losing in battle to her - if you hadn't, perhaps you wouldn't have lived the rest of your life getting butt-stuffed by her inhuman cock without rest."},
			{"text": "With a whimper, that thought leaves your mind, as you sprinkle her straw with your anally-induced sperm for what might be the thousandth time.  Soon, she'll screech, and dump her bird-brained excuse of a reproductive act in your bowels, likewise for the thousandth time, but all you can think about, with that thought returning, is what would have happened if you won."}
